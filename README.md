# EPCIS-IoT-Arduino

This repository sends sensor information to MQTT Broker in the [InfluxDB Line Protocol Format](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/) for Topics that are created based on data from [EPCIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPCIS) Vocabulary.

## Hardware
* __ESP32-WROOM__

## Software
* `arduino-esp32` library
* `PubSubClient` library
* `Adafruit_BME280` library

## Concept

In production environments, products are tracked using __EPC__ (Electronic Product Code) via Barcodes or QR-Codes. Using EPCIS Data Model the following questions are answered for
the product underconsideration:

* __WHAT__
* __WHERE__
* __WHEN__
* __WHY__

IoT sensors cannot be directly connected to products in many cases. Environmental parameters which might affect the product need to be associated with it. For e.g.:

> What was the environment like _when_ the product was somewhere within the production facility?

### Topic Creation

Usage of the following vocabulary from EPCIS can be used to create topics:

| Vocabulary | Example |
|------------|---------|
| __company__| _acme_  |
| __site__   | _factory_ |
| __country code__ | _US_ |
| __city__ | _dallas_ |

Topic: `<company>/<site>/<country_code>/<city>/<sensor_node_mac_address>/<measurement_type>`

`<measurement_type>` is dependent on the type of sensor measurement.E.g.: `env` for Environmental measurements like temperature, humidity, atm. pressure etc.
`<sensor_node_mac_address>` is the unique MAC address of the WLAN/BLE Chip on the node

__Example__

    acme/factory/US/dallas/AA:BB:DE:AD:BE:EF/env

### Payload

In general a very simple Line Protocol format is sent as MQTT payload. The Line Protocol is as follows:

    env,sType=BME280 temp=24.3,humid=59.3 <unix_epoch_timestamp_in_seconds>

`sType`: is the name of the sensor where the data is generated from.
`<unix_epoch_timestamp_in_seconds>`: obtained from SNTP Server.

## Usage
* MQTT packets generally send the payload and topic together to the broker
* A Wildcard topic can be used to subscribe to all sensors within a production area

        <company_name>/<site>/<country_code>/<city>/+/<measurement_name>
    
    E.g.:

        acme/factory/US/dallas/+/env
    
    provides all the sensor values within the Acme Factory situated in Dallas, US

* A simple parsing mechanism / script can subscribe to the topic and extract location information from the topic and add them as `tags` to the Line Protocol _before sending_ it to InfluxDB.

* A simple _Map_ or _dictionary_ is used before sending the data to InfluxDB to associate Sensor Hardware (MAC) Address to a Business Location (`bizLocation`)
    E.g.: Mapping Sensor MAC Address to Business Location
    
        {
            'AA:BB:DE:AD:BE:EF': 'urn:id:loc:sgln:ACME.1'
        }


* E.g.: After parsing the topic and mapping the sensor hardware address to resp. business location, the Line Protocol Payload appears as follows:

        env,sType=BME280,company=acme,site=factory,countryCode=US,city=dallas,sId=AA:BB:DE:AD:BE:EF,bizLocation=urn:id:loc:sgln:ACME.1 temp=24.3,humid=59.3 <unix_epoch_timestamp_in_seconds>

### Example
* `EpcisMqttIoT` example provides the Arduino Sketch to achieve the mentioned concept.
* Within `Settings.h` adapt the configurations necessary:
    * WLAN Configuration
    * MQTT Configuration
    * Topic Metadata Configuration
* Use it with `BME280` to send Temperature, Humidity values

## Querying Logic

You can now query sensor information based on indices from the EPCIS vocabulary as follows:

1. Get environmental information for Acme Factory situated in Dallas:

        SELECT temp, humid FROM env WHERE "company"='acme' AND "site"='factory' AND "city"='dallas'

2. Get environmental information for _business location 1_ in Acme Factory for the last hour:

        SELECT temp, humid FROM env WHERE "company"='acme' AND "site"='factory' AND "bizLocation"='urn:id:loc:sgln:ACME.1' AND time > now() - 1h
